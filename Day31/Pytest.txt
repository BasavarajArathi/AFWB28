PyTest-Unit Testing tool or Framework
used to run multiple tests and generate report
in PyTest module,class and method should start with 'test'
we run the test from terminal
	Right click on the package-->Open in -->terminal
in the terminal use the cmd 'pytest'
>pytest

it will collect all the methods which starts with 'test' and runs them one by one automatically
>pytest -v              verbose (more details)


>pytest -vs             verbose + std o/p

>pytest test_demo1.py  -vs

>pytest test_demo2.py::Test_Class3  -vs

>pytest test_demo2.py::Test_Class3::test_method6  -vs

pip install pytest-html

>pytest --html=myreport.html

To check which package->module->class->method will be considered for execution
pytest --collect-only

i dont want to run a test
@pytest.mark.skip 

@pytest.mark.skip(reason="there is a known issue 123") 

@pytest.mark.skipif(a<b)

@pytest.mark.skipif(a<b,reason="a < b so skipping")

Any word which starts with @ ----> annotation-- syntatic meta data

to perfom verification we use assert

by default pytest will continue the execution even if there are any failures
in order to stop the execution (when any test failed) then use -x

pytest test_demo4.py -vs -x		- stop at 1st fail

pytest test_demo4.py -vs --maxFail=4    - stop at 4th fail

rerun only failed test
pytest test_demo4.py -vs --lf

Note: if there are no failures in last execution then above cmd will rerun all the tests

How to re run all methods but failed first then the passed ones
pytest test_demo4.py -vs --ff

By default execution order is --->alphabatical order of file and top to bottom of the methods

To run the test method in req order we use --> pip install pytest-ordering
@pytest.mark.run(order=1)
@pytest.mark.run(order=2)

 

How do u run create user 1st and then create  product----ANS: 
1. run 'create user'  (Pass/Fail) 
2. run 'create product'

----ANS: ensure that method1 is  create user and method 2 is create product
         use 'order' create user order is 1,    create product order is 2


How do u run delete customer after create customer is passed
1. run 'create customer'  (pass/fail)
2. run 'delete customer' only if 'create customer' is passed

ANS: use dependency
pip install pytest-dependency

specify the name for dependency for create customer method-->
@pytest.mark.dependency(name="create_customer")

specify the dependency in  delete customer method-->
@pytest.mark.dependency(depends=["create_customer"])

Note: a method can depend on multiple methods

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
to run a test multiple times with diff inputs we should use 'parameterize'

@pytest.mark.parametrize("customer_name",("bhanu","basava"))
def test_customer(customer_name):
        print("create customer:",customer_name)

@pytest.mark.parametrize("name,mrp",[("java",10000),("selenium",12000)])
def test_product(name,mrp):
        print("product name:",name)
        print("product mrp:", mrp)


to run methods based on keywords
pytest -vs -k user

We can create our own marker for grouping the tests
create a file with the name pytest.ini with following content
[pytest]
markers=
        smoke: this is smoke test case
        regression: this is regression test case
        customer: this is customer module test case
        product:this is product module test case
        user: this is user module test case


specify these markers in test

@pytest.mark.user
@pytest.mark.smoke
def test_create_user():
    print("test_create_user")


run it using -m

>pytest -vs -m smoke

>pytest -vs -m 'smoke and user'


>pytest -vs -m 'smoke or user'


>pytest -vs -m 'not smoke'
